					<h4 class="title-h4">How a contract is formed between you and us using our website:</h4>
					<p>After placing an order on Our Website, you will receive a Confirmation Email. This does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy the product(s) you have ordered. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. Orders will only be accepted by us upon dispatch of the product(s) you have ordered. We will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email which confirms that the order has been dispatched ("Dispatch Confirmation"). The contract will be formed when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation, unless we notify you that we do not accept your order or if you have cancelled it. By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product on and subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Dispatch times may vary according to availability and any guarantees or representations made as to delivery times are limited to mainland UK and subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be responsible. Please see our Buying from Us notice for further information. In order to contract with DegreeArt.com you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us. DegreeArt.com retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is accepted we will inform you by email or phone and we will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted with. This will usually be DegreeArt.com or may in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third party DegreeArt.com is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes.</p>
					<ol class="ordered-list">
						<li><span class="ordered-list__underline">Our Contract:</span> When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail or phone confirming receipt of your order: this communication will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us will not be formed until we provide you with confirmation by e-mail or phone that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.</li>
						<li><span class="ordered-list__underline">Pricing and Availability:</span> Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund. Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in the 'Total Cost' on your order confirmation.</li>
						<li><span class="ordered-list__underline">Payment:</span> Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Goods will not be dispatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed. Your card will be debited once the order has been accepted.</li>
