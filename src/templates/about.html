						<h5 class="title-h5">Why 1340Gallery?</h5>
						<p>1340gallery was born out of frustration. With the1340art magazine we want to give upcoming artist around the world a platform to express themselves and to show their work to a broader audience. We come across a lot of very talented artists. Unfortunately selling art on a larger scale or even globally can be difficult for any upcoming artist. "No Unsolicited Submissions", is a response, which many artists receive when they reach out to an art gallery or museum to introduce their work. 1340gallery is here to make a change in this arena. We want to make the pieces of art of the best and the most talented artists available for the public and the world.</p>
